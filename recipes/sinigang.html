    <h3>A Classic Filipino Dish</h3>
    <p><i>Sinigang</i> comes from the root word <i>“sigang”</i> which means to stew or simmer in a broth, characterized by its sour and savory taste. It is one of the more popular dishes in Filipino cuisine, and like most Filipino dishes, is usually accompanied by rice.</p>
    <p>This dish has a few variations and for this recipe, we'll be making the most popular variation which is the Pork <i>Sinigang</i> or locally called <em>Sinigang na baboy</em>. Other proteins and seafood can also be used, such as beef, shrimp, and fish (specifically <i>bangus</i> or milkfish).</p>
