    <h3>A Classic Filipino Dish</h3>
    <p><i>Sinigang</i> comes from the root word <i>“sigang”</i> which means to stew or simmer in a broth, characterized by its sour and savory taste. It is one of the more popular dishes in Filipino cuisine, and like most Filipino dishes, is usually accompanied by rice.</p>
    <p>This dish has a few variations and for this recipe, we'll be making the most popular variation which is the Pork <i>Sinigang</i> or locally called <em>Sinigang na baboy</em>. Other proteins and seafood can also be used, such as beef, shrimp, and fish (specifically <i>bangus</i> or milkfish).</p>

    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse pork ribs and drain well.</li>
        <li>In a pot over medium heat, combine pork and enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, skimming scum that accumulates on top.</li>
        <li>Once broth clears, add tomatoes, onion, and fish sauce. Lower heat and simmer for about an hour or until meat is tender, adding more water as necessary to maintain about 8 cups.</li>
        <li>Add <i>gabi</i> and <i>kangkong</i> stalks. Cook for about 4 to 6 minutes or until tender.</li>
        <li>Add green chilis and radish. Continue to simmer for about 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add <i>kangkong</i> leaves and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>If using packaged tamarind base powder, add to the pot and stir until completely dissolved. If using tamarind fresh pods made:
            <ol>
                <li>Wash tamarind and place in a saucepan with 1 cup water. Bring to a boil and cook until soft and outer skins begin to burst.</li>
                <li>With a fork, mash tamarinds.</li>
                <li>In a fine-mesh strainer set over a bowl, pour tamarind and liquid. Continue to mash with a fork, returning some of the liquid into the strainer once or twice, to fully extract the juice.</li>
                <li>Discard seeds and skins. Pour tamarind juice into the pot of sinigang.</li>
            </ol>
