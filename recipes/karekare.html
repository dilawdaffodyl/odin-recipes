    <h3>A Classic Filipino Dish</h3>
    <p><i>Kare-Kare</i> (derives from "curry") is a traditional Filipino stew complimented with a rich, thick savory peanut sauce. Like most Filipino dishes, the best way to eat <i>kare-kare</i> is to pair it with plain white rice. <i>Bagoong alamang</i> or fermented shrimp paste completes the dish by providing flavor. Remember though that a tiny, almost pea-sized shrimp paste is enough for a spoonful of this delicacy.</p>
