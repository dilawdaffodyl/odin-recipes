    <h3>A Classic Filipino Dish</h3>
    <p>Chicken Macaroni <i>Sopas</i> is a rich noodle soup, with tender chicken nestled next to elbow macaroni and carrots swirling in a savory, creamy broth. With its warm, rich taste, sopas is now a comfort food, popular especially during rainy weather.</p>
    <p>The etymology of the word <i>sopas</i> comes from the Spanish word <i>sopa</i>, which means soup. While the origin of this Filipino dish is the American chicken noodle soup introduced during the American colonial period of the Philippines, it has been adapted to fit the Filipino palate.</p>
